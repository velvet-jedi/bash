read exp


printf "%.3f\n" `echo "$exp" | bc -l`

# bc - An arbitrary precision calculator language
# -l,  Define the standard math library.
# $exp (which presumably holds a mathematical expression) and   # pipes it into the bc command with the -l option.

# "$(...)": This is command substitution. The result of the echo # "$exp" | bc -l` command is captured and substituted into the   # outer command.
